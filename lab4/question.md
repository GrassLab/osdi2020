> Q: Consider the following POSIX signal example code. Can you elaborate how to design the kernel to support it?
A: 
- Signal registration: User specify the handler for specific signal. Kernel register it into structure.
- Signal generation: Kernel send the signal to the process' pending signal. Signal is generated by kernel or user via kernel.
- Signal delivery: When process enter kernel mode via trap. Kernel checks the pending signal and block the remaining signal. Call the registered function.
