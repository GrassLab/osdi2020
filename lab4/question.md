# Lab4 Questions

> Q: Consider the following POSIX signal example code. Can you elaborate how to design the kernel to support it?
A: 
- Signal registration: User specify the handler for specific signal. Kernel register it into structure.
- Signal generation: Kernel send the signal to the process' pending signal. Signal is generated by kernel or user via kernel.
- Signal delivery: When process enter kernel mode via trap. Kernel checks the pending signal and block the remaining signal. Call the registered function.

> Q: Can you prevent all possible context switch by disabling interrupt?
A: If all possible incoming interrupts are disabled. And all the context do not explicitly call scheduler. Then yes. But some OS may insert scheduler invoke in kernel mode system call.

> Q: Do you think microkernel need to be preemptive kernel or not? Why or why not?
A: Maybe not. Driver runs in user mode. Interrupts is send as IPC. Realtime ? L4 is non-preemptive, L4/Fiasco is preemptive kernel.
